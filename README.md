My code for the card game Casino (rules can be found here:http://www.pagat.com/fishing/casino.html)

I'm working on making the card game Casino using pygame. Currently you can only play one hand against the computer, but in the future I hope to add the following things:

-The ability to play multiple hands (up to a game, which ends when someone gets 21 points) as well as being able to start a new game in the same window

-Making the computer player smarter

-Play online against another person (instead of the computer)
