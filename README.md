My code for the card game Casino (rules can be found here: http://www.pagat.com/fishing/casino.html).

I'm working on making the card game Casino using pygame. In the future I hope to add the following things:

-Making the computer player smarter

-Play online against another person (instead of the computer)

-Nice buttons that people expect, like "start a new game"


The file to run to play the game is CasinoWhileLoop.py

Enjoy!
